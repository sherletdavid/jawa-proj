movie reservation system
Movie Seat Booking System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of reserving movie theater seats. The system allows users to select a movie, view available seating in a graphical layout, choose their preferred seats, and confirm their booking. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, and Node.js with Express and MySQL on the backend, the application provides a smooth, real-time booking experience. Seat selections are validated and submitted to the server, where booking information is securely stored in a relational MySQL database. Once booked, seats are marked as occupied and become unavailable to other users, preventing double-bookings. The system dynamically calculates ticket pricing based on the selected movie and the number of seats chosen. This project demonstrates essential full-stack development practices including API integration, database operations, and user interface interactivity, making it a solid foundation for more advanced cinema or event booking systems.
